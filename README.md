Curious baby wants to Quiz you.


#Problems :

* ~~HOW to ADD new Question ? from a FORM.~~
* Fetching values from FORM and using VIEWS to save in DB. [Almost done]
* TO get the PK of the last Question and increment and then use for insertion. [Didn't understand]

# TODO :

1. Modify Question Button, with each Question.
2. ADD/REMOVE Choices for a Question.
3. Adding more than one choice for a New Question. (Related to 2)
